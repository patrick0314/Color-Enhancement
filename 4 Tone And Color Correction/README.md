# Tone and Color Correction + SLIC + CIECAM02

1. Use tone and color correction with the function `log((a-1)*img+1]) / log(a)` where `a` is a constant to modify the image. We can see that this method exactly enhances the image with dim backlight. However, in the bright part of image, color become too bright and not the same  color from our perspective. This is because the fixed parameter `a`. If we set `a` too large, the bright part of image would become all white; on the other hand, if we set `a` too small, the dark part would not enhance enough.

2. We think that the dark part of images will in the same area and the bright part of images will in other same area. Therefore, we use SLIC to segment the image into few groups. By this, we can use different parameter `a` to modify images under different lightness.

3. We use the mean color value of the segmented groups as sample color and throw it into CIECAM02 model to calculate lightness $J$ and chroma $C$. This is because we think these two parameter can represent lightness of groups. Set `a = np.sqrt(1 / J*C)`. Under this circumstance, we can see that the performance become better due the adaptation of parameter `a`.

## Requirement

```
numpy==1.23.5
opencv-python==4.6.0.66
```

## Usage

* [ToneAndColorCorrection.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/blob/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/ToneAndColorCorrection.py) implement Tone and Color Correction on input data folder - [natural image](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/tree/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/images/natural%20image) and save the results with name `XX_v2.png` in the folder - [natural image results](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/tree/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/images/natural%20image%20results)

* [SLIC.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/blob/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/SLIC.py) implement Tone and Color Correction + SLIC + CIECAM02 model on input data folder - [natural image](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/tree/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/images/natural%20image) and save the results with name `XX_v3.png` in the folder - [natural image results](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/tree/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/images/natural%20image%20results)

* [SimulatingImgDimBack.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/blob/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/SimulatingImgDimBack.py) can show the comparison between original img & the img with dim backlight and save the results in the folder - [results](https://github.com/patrick0314/DIP-Final-Project/tree/main/4%20Tone%20And%20Color%20Correction/images/results)

## Results

The left part of images are original images. The second part of images are the ground truth of Exploiting Perceptual Anchoring for Color Image Enhancement. The third part of images are the results of Tone and Color Correction. And the right part of images are the proposed results of our method.
