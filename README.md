# Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement

## Requirement

```
numpy==1.23.5
opencv-python==4.6.0.66
```

## Usage

* [ColorPatchEnhanced.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/ColorPatchEnhanced.py) implement color enhancement on input data folder - [color patch](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/images/color%20patch) and save the results in the folder - [color patch results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/images/color%20patch%20results)

* [NaturalImgEnhanced.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/NaturalImgEnhanced.py) implement color enhancement on input data folder - [natural image](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/images/natural%20image) and save the results in the folder - [natural image results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/images/natural%20image%20results)

* [SimulatingImgDimBack.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/SimulatingImgDimBack.py) can show the comparison between original img & the img with dim backlight and save the results in the folder - [results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/images/results)

## Results

The left-most row are the original image and its dim backlight version. The second are is the proposed results of ["Exploiting Perceptual Anchoring
for Color Image Enhancement"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7337421). The third row are our implement of ["Exploiting Perceptual Anchoring
for Color Image Enhancement"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7337421). And the last row are the implement of tone and color correction.
