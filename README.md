# Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement

## Requirement

```
numpy==1.23.5
opencv-python==4.6.0.66
```

## Usage

* [ColorPatchEnhanced.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/ColorPatchEnhanced.py) implement color enhancement on input data folder [color patch](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/results_tmm/color%20patch) and save the results in the folder [color patch results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/results_tmm/color%20patch%20results)

* [NaturalImgEnhanced.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/NaturalImgEnhanced.py) implement color enhancement on input data folder [natural image](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/results_tmm/natural%20image) and save the results in the folder [natural image results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/results_tmm/natural%20image%20results)

* [SimulatingImgDimBack.py](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/blob/main/SimulatingImgDimBack.py) can show the img & enhanced img with dim backlight and save the results in the folder [results](https://github.com/patrick0314/Exploiting-Perceptual-Anchoring-for-Color-Image-Enhancement/tree/main/results_tmm)
